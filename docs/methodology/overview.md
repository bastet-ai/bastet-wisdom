# Methodology Overview

This section outlines the systematic approach to security testing and bug bounty hunting used in the Bastet security framework.

## üéØ Core Principles

Our methodology is built on four core principles:

1. **Systematic Approach**: Follow a structured process to ensure comprehensive coverage
2. **Documentation**: Record all findings and methodologies for repeatability
3. **Ethical Testing**: Always operate within legal and ethical boundaries
4. **Continuous Learning**: Adapt and improve based on new discoveries

## üìä Testing Phases

### 1. Reconnaissance Phase
- **Passive Information Gathering**: OSINT, public records, social media
- **Active Reconnaissance**: Subdomain enumeration, port scanning, service detection
- **Attack Surface Mapping**: Identify entry points and potential targets

### 2. Vulnerability Assessment
- **Automated Scanning**: Use tools to identify common vulnerabilities
- **Manual Testing**: Deep-dive analysis of complex business logic
- **Code Review**: Static and dynamic analysis when source code is available

### 3. Exploitation
- **Proof of Concept**: Develop working exploits for identified vulnerabilities
- **Impact Assessment**: Determine the real-world impact of successful exploits
- **Chain Building**: Combine multiple vulnerabilities for maximum impact

### 4. Post-Exploitation
- **Privilege Escalation**: Attempt to gain higher-level access
- **Lateral Movement**: Explore additional systems and services
- **Data Exfiltration**: Demonstrate the potential for data theft (ethically)

## üîÑ Iterative Process

Security testing is an iterative process. As new information is discovered, previous phases may need to be revisited:

    A[Recon] --> B[Assessment]
    B --> C[Exploitation]
    C --> D[Post-Exploitation]
    D --> A
    D --> E[Reporting]
```

## üìù Documentation Standards

Throughout all phases, maintain detailed documentation:

- **Methodology Used**: Record the specific techniques and tools employed
- **Findings**: Document all vulnerabilities, even those not exploitable
- **Screenshots**: Capture evidence of successful exploitation
- **Reproduction Steps**: Provide clear instructions for verifying findings

## üé≠ Scope Management

Always clearly define and respect the testing scope:

- **In-Scope Assets**: Systems explicitly approved for testing
- **Out-of-Scope Assets**: Systems that must not be tested
- **Testing Methods**: Approved and prohibited testing techniques
- **Timing Constraints**: When testing can and cannot be performed

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Assessment

Evaluate risks throughout the testing process:

- **Technical Risk**: Potential for system disruption or damage
- **Legal Risk**: Compliance with terms of engagement
- **Reputational Risk**: Impact on organization's reputation
- **Data Risk**: Potential exposure of sensitive information
