# Git config, template, OAuth, and object-path boundaries from July 24 GHSA updates

A late July 24 advisory wave adds four reusable checks: repository metadata serialized into trusted Git configuration, server-side template property reads that recover the JavaScript `Function` constructor, OAuth URL globs that cross authority/path boundaries, and dotted update paths that mutate `Object.prototype` during Mongoose casting.

!!! warning "Authorized validation only"
    Use disposable repositories and Git configuration, inert template counters, owned OAuth clients/origins and fake authorization codes, and fresh Node processes with synthetic Mongoose updates. Never trigger an injected Git command, run a template shell payload, collect real authorization codes, modify production records, or test process-global prototype changes in shared workers.

## GitPython submodule name to repository config

GitPython through 3.1.52 rejected CR, LF, and NUL in config names, but a same-line section/subsection name could contain bracket, quote, space, and comment syntax. A submodule name from `.gitmodules`, or from an application calling `Repo.create_submodule(name=...)`, could therefore close the intended `[submodule "..."]` header and inject another Git configuration directive into the parent repository's trusted `.git/config`. GitPython 3.1.53 adds the fix.

### Parse-only proof

1. Create a disposable parent repository and a benign local bare repository to use as the submodule URL. Set temporary `HOME`, `GIT_CONFIG_GLOBAL`, and `GIT_CONFIG_SYSTEM` values so no host configuration is read or changed.
2. Add a control submodule with a normal name and inventory the resulting `.git/config`.
3. In a fresh parent, use a name shaped to close the quoted submodule section and introduce an inert key such as `skillz.marker=canary` in a second section on the same line. Do not inject `core.sshCommand`, `alias`, pager, hook, or filesystem-monitor values.
4. Read the raw config and use `git config --get skillz.marker` as a parser oracle. Do not run fetch, pull, push, aliases, pagers, hooks, or any command that could realize an executable config sink.
5. Repeat both through the direct `create_submodule` path and, when in scope, clone plus `submodule_update(init=True)` using a fully local hostile fixture.
6. Confirm GitPython 3.1.53 rejects or safely encodes the name.

Strong evidence is **attacker-controlled submodule name -> GitPython emits a second same-line config section -> native Git parses a marker directive from trusted repository config**. Explain that executable directives can create RCE on later Git operations, but keep the proof parse-only.

## Velocity.js property-read to `Function`

The earlier Velocity.js fix blocked `__proto__`, `constructor`, and `prototype` on `#set` assignment targets. In 2.1.6, read expressions remained unfiltered, so a template could traverse an ordinary object's constructor chain to JavaScript's `Function` constructor, build a function, and invoke it. Version 2.1.7 closes the read path.

### No-shell renderer harness

1. Confirm the application renders attacker-controlled Velocity template syntax, not merely data values in a trusted template.
2. In a local harness, expose an empty object and a test-only global counter function. The marker function must only increment memory or append to a temp event list.
3. Use a template expression that reads constructor properties and constructs a function whose body calls only the marker counter. Do not reference `process`, `require`, environment variables, child processes, filesystem, or network APIs.
4. Capture the template AST/property-read trace, constructor identity, marker count before/after render, rendered output, and version.
5. Test direct output expressions and right-hand expressions separately if both are reachable. Do not assume the `#set` target fix covers property reads elsewhere.
6. Repeat on 2.1.7 and with trusted-template/untrusted-data controls.

Report **attacker-controlled template -> inherited `constructor.constructor` property reads -> dynamic Function creation -> inert server-process side effect**. If users only control interpolation data, the advisory's template-control precondition is absent.

## Backstage OAuth URL-component glob confusion

The vulnerable behavior is limited to `@backstage/plugin-auth-backend` through 0.29.1 when experimental dynamic client registration or client-ID metadata documents are explicitly enabled with custom patterns. Defaults and disabled features are not affected. Matching a glob against the entire URL allowed a hostname wildcard to consume `/` and path text, protocol-less patterns to match unintended schemes, and credential-bearing URLs to be normalized before matching.

### Two-origin registration matrix

Use a test Backstage instance, an owned trusted-pattern domain, an owned attacker-control domain, a disposable OAuth client, and authorization codes containing no user authority beyond a canary profile.

| Pattern/input | What to vary | Expected decision |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `https://*.trusted.example/callback` | true subdomain vs attacker host whose path contains `.trusted.example/callback` | only true subdomain allowed |
| protocol-less custom pattern | `https`, `http`, and non-HTTP scheme | configuration rejected or exact intended scheme only |
| credential-bearing redirect | `https://user:pass@owned.example/callback` | rejected, not stripped then matched |
| loopback with wildcard port | root path vs non-root path | document 0.29.2 component semantics |

1. Record feature flags and the exact custom allowlist; package presence alone is insufficient.
2. Attempt client registration or metadata-document resolution with each owned URL.
3. If an unintended redirect is accepted, run one authorization flow using a disposable user and intercept only a fake/canary code at the owned destination. Do not redeem a real user's code or token.
4. Repeat on plugin-auth-backend 0.29.2.

The chain is **custom full-URL glob -> wildcard crosses authority/path component -> attacker-owned redirect accepted -> canary authorization code delivered to wrong origin**. State which experimental feature and pattern made it reachable.

## Mongoose dotted update-path prototype mutation

In affected Mongoose 6.x through 9.x lines, casting a user-controlled update such as an own `$set` key beginning `__proto__.` could assign internal schema metadata (`$fullPath` and `$parentSchemaDocArray`) onto `Object.prototype`. The cast may throw after the mutation, so an error response does not prove the process state remained clean. Fixed releases are 6.13.10, 7.8.10, 8.24.1, and 9.7.2.

### Fresh-process state proof

1. Start a one-shot Node process with a minimal schema and no database connection required beyond the actual application path under test.
2. Build the update with `JSON.parse()` so `__proto__` is an own data property; avoid JavaScript object-literal semantics that may instead alter only the payload object's prototype.
3. Snapshot own/enumerable properties on `Object.prototype` and a fresh `{}` before casting.
4. Send only a marker update path and invoke the same update casting path the application reaches. Catch errors, then snapshot process-global prototype state again.
5. Test downstream impact only with an inert policy object in the same disposable process—for example, whether an inherited marker changes a synthetic branch. Do not mutate authorization, shell, template, or database behavior.
6. Exit the process after every case. Repeat with the appropriate patched release and with update sanitization enabled.

A valid finding proves **attacker-controlled update object -> dotted `__proto__` path reaches schema lookup/casting -> Mongoose writes enumerable internal fields onto `Object.prototype` despite an eventual throw**. Do not call this arbitrary prototype pollution unless attacker control over property names/values beyond the confirmed internal fields is independently shown, and do not claim privilege escalation without a concrete reachable downstream consumer.

## Reporting notes

Lead with the exact boundary and trigger:

- submodule/config section name to repository-local Git directive;
- template property read to dynamic function construction;
- OAuth full-string glob to mismatched URL authority;
- own dotted update key to process-global prototype metadata.

Include version, route/API, attacker-control provenance, raw and parsed representations, side-effect timing, patched negative control, and marker-only evidence. Keep all proofs in disposable, single-purpose environments.

## Late follow-up: Prompty Nunjucks template member access

[GHSA-w28w-gp39-m4p6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w28w-gp39-m4p6) adds the same high-level read-to-constructor lesson as Velocity.js to a distinct AI prompt-template surface. Affected `@prompty/core` TypeScript runtimes through 0.1.4 and 2.0.0-beta.4 render `.prompty` bodies with Nunjucks member access that can traverse constructor/prototype properties and invoke functions in the host Node.js process. The patched 2.0.0-beta.5 renderer restricts inputs to own data, blocks constructor/prototype traversal, and disallows template function calls while retaining ordinary interpolation, loops, and conditionals.

### Prompty-specific reachability

Confirm the application renders `.prompty` files through the TypeScript runtime and that an attacker can influence the **template body**, not only ordinary prompt variables. Relevant sources include community prompt packages, cloned repositories, uploaded prompt definitions, agent-generated templates, or marketplace content. A Python runtime, trusted template with untrusted scalar values, or package presence without rendering is not enough.

### Inert renderer proof

1. Run `@prompty/core` in a disposable Node process with a local `.prompty` file and synthetic render data.
2. Give the test data one inert function that increments an in-memory counter; expose no process, filesystem, environment, shell, package-manager, or network capability.
3. Establish ordinary interpolation, conditional, loop, and own nested-property controls.
4. Attempt constructor/prototype member traversal and a call to the inert counter through the same default or explicit Nunjucks renderer the application uses.
5. Record the parsed template body, member lookup sequence, function-call decision, counter before/after, and rendered marker.
6. Repeat on 2.0.0-beta.5 or later. Ordinary data rendering should remain functional while unsafe member lookups and calls fail.

Report **attacker-controlled `.prompty` body -> unrestricted Nunjucks member traversal -> function object reached/called -> inert host-process side effect**. Do not use a shell command, read environment variables, install packages, or test untrusted prompts on an agent host carrying real credentials.
