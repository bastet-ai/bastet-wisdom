# Framework authentication, static-path, and policy-field boundaries from July 24 GHSA updates

This July 24 wave yields four durable source-assisted checks: high-level OpenAPI middleware silently installing no-op authentication, Apache Camel validating only token presence under its documented default Keycloak policy, static-file authorization running on a different path representation than file resolution, and CEL exposing Go fields that JSON tags appear to hide.

!!! warning "Authorized validation only"
    Use local fixtures, synthetic routes, marker files, fake bearer values, and structs containing canary fields. Never retrieve production static files, submit forged tokens to third-party services, or evaluate expressions against real credentials or customer objects.

## kin-openapi: declared security versus installed authenticator

`github.com/getkin/kin-openapi` through 0.143.0 behaves differently across two APIs. Direct `ValidateRequest` fails closed when `AuthenticationFunc` is nil, but `openapi3filter.ValidationHandler.Load()` replaces nil with `NoopAuthenticationFunc`. The no-op returns success for every OpenAPI security scheme, so applications that rely on the high-level handler as their enforcement layer can pass an unauthenticated request to a protected route. Version 0.144.0 removes the implicit substitution.

### Minimal decision-table proof

1. Confirm the application uses `ValidationHandler`, calls `Load()`, omits `AuthenticationFunc`, and relies on OpenAPI `security` declarations for enforcement. Package presence or schema validation alone is insufficient.
2. Build a local OpenAPI fixture with one public route and one route protected by a synthetic `X-Canary-Key` API-key scheme. Both handlers should return only marker text.
3. Send the protected request with no header, a wrong marker, and the expected marker. Record the handler counter and status.
4. Run the same request through direct `ValidateRequest` with nil authentication to establish the library's fail-closed contrast.
5. Repeat with an explicit test authenticator and with 0.144.0. Missing authentication must not reach the protected marker handler.

Report **declared OpenAPI security -> high-level middleware injects no-op authenticator -> protected handler executes without credentials**. Do not report applications that install a separate, effective authentication layer ahead of this middleware.

## Apache Camel: token presence is not token verification

In `org.apache.camel:camel-keycloak` 4.15.0 through 4.18.2 and 4.19.0 through 4.20.x, `KeycloakSecurityPolicy` verifies token signature, issuer, expiry, or introspection state only inside role or permission checks. Both `requiredRoles` and `requiredPermissions` default to empty in the documented basic setup. With those defaults and header token input enabled, any non-null bearer value passes the presence gate without cryptographic verification. Fixed releases are 4.18.3 and 4.21.0.

### Fake-token route matrix

Use a disposable Camel route whose only side effect is incrementing an in-memory counter.

| Policy/input | Expected secure result |
| --- | --- |
| no bearer value | reject |
| arbitrary non-JWT marker | reject |
| unsigned synthetic JWT with wrong issuer | reject |
| expired JWT signed by a lab key | reject |
| valid lab token | reach marker route |
| non-empty role requirement, wrong role | reject |

Capture whether the verifier or owned introspection stub was called, not only the final status. A positive finding proves **bearer presence -> empty role/permission branches skip all verification -> route executes**. Do not describe downstream RCE unless that exact protected route independently reaches a code-execution producer and explicit authorization permits proving it.

### Platform-HTTP JWT follow-up: iss/aud skipped when unset (GHSA-fpm2-m4qq-wghr / CVE-2026-66908)

In `org.apache.camel:camel-platform-http-main` 4.8.0 through 4.21.x, `JWTAuthenticationConfigurer.buildJwtOptions` returns `null` when **neither `jwtIssuer` nor `jwtAudience` is configured**, and the caller then skips `JWTAuthOptions.setJWTOptions` entirely. The Vert.x `JWTAuth` instance is built from the keystore alone, so inbound tokens are checked for **signature and expiry only** — `iss` and `aud` claims are never validated. The server starts normally with no warning; the component documentation presents signature/expiry checking as the default and issuer/audience as an optional extra. Both the application server and management server paths are affected. Fixed in 4.22.0.

Operator deltas from the matrix above:

- **Mint a lab-issued token with a *wrong* `iss` and `aud`** (signed by the trusted keystore key, unexpired). Positive: the route accepts it even though the documented claim checks are not enforced.
- **Mint a token for a *different service audience*** than the target route's intended scope. Positive: cross-audience token accepted.
- **Negative control on 4.22.0+**: the same two tokens must be rejected.
- Evidence: the `buildJwtOptions` return value / `setJWTOptions` call path, the accepted/declared claim set, and the route marker hit. Do not harvest real tokens; use synthetic lab-signed values only.

## `@fastify/static`: authorize and resolve the same canonical path

Two advisories cover distinct representation mismatches:

- through 10.1.0, non-leading `..` or `%2E%2E` can cause `find-my-way` to select the static catch-all rather than a guarded route; later file resolution collapses the segments ([GHSA-83w8-p2f5-377r](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-83w8-p2f5-377r));
- through 10.1.1, `allowedPath` sees a pre-normalized pathname while file resolution collapses dot segments and duplicate slashes ([GHSA-8pvw-jcv7-9cmj](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8pvw-jcv7-9cmj)).

Use 10.1.2 or later as the fixed control for both.

### Synthetic static-root replay

1. Create a disposable static root with `public/allowed.txt` and `private/denied.txt`, both containing unique non-sensitive markers.
2. Protect `/private/*` with the application's actual route hook and independently deny `private/` in `allowedPath`.
3. Record the raw URL, router-selected handler, value passed to `allowedPath`, normalized send path, resolved file, hook decision, and response.
4. Test a small matrix: canonical paths, duplicate slashes, `/./`, `public/../private/`, and both literal and encoded non-leading dot-dot segments.
5. A valid bypass returns only the synthetic denied marker after the policy evaluated a different representation. Stop there; do not enumerate a real static root.
6. Repeat on 10.1.2. The policy and resolver must bind to the same canonical path.

Keep the two causes separate in reports: catch-all route selection bypasses route-family middleware, while pre-normalized `allowedPath` input bypasses a plugin callback.

## cel-go: JSON skip tags are not CEL policy

In `github.com/google/cel-go` 0.22.0 through 0.28.1, `ext.NativeTypes(ext.ParseStructTag("json"))` registers a Go field tagged `json:"-"` under the literal CEL name `"-"`. Because native objects support index access, an untrusted expression can read it using a dynamic lookup. Native type registration also recursively discovers nested struct types. Version 0.29.0 supplies the fixed control.

### Canary-field harness

1. Confirm untrusted users can submit CEL expressions and that the host registers native Go structs with `NativeTypes(ParseStructTag("json"))`.
2. Define a test struct with a public marker and a private canary tagged `json:"-"`; include one nested synthetic type.
3. Verify standard JSON serialization omits the canary.
4. Enumerate CEL-visible field names and evaluate ordinary field access plus dynamic index access to the literal skip-tag name. Log only marker values.
5. Repeat conversion to a JSON-like CEL value, because the same name mapping can expose the field during conversion.
6. Repeat on 0.29.0 and with an explicit allowlisted CEL object schema.

The finding is **developer-intended JSON omission -> native-type adapter registers the skipped field -> untrusted CEL expression reads the canary**. Do not infer access to every application secret: identify the exact struct, expression channel, and restricted field reachable in the deployed integration.

## Reporting checklist

Include the package and version, exact wrapper/API in use, attacker-controlled input source, raw and canonical representations, route or field actually reached, marker-only evidence, and patched negative control. Distinguish a library behavior from application impact: each result needs a reachable protected handler, static marker, or private canary field.
