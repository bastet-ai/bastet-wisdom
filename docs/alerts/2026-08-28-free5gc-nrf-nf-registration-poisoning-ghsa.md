# free5GC NRF NF-registration poisoning via unvalidated NF Profile endpoints — operator validation

**Date reviewed:** 2026-08-28 (updated 2026-08-31: added Boundary 2, the AUSF SUPI-keyed auth-context overwrite)
**Advisory:** [GHSA-x8mj-6p3q-g5pp / CVE-2026-55068](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-x8mj-6p3q-g5pp) — critical; [GHSA-334q-h5g3-fpxv / CVE-2026-55784](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-334q-h5g3-fpxv) — high (CVSS 7.5)
**Affected:** free5GC NRF `nnrf-nfm` `RegisterNFInstance` (`PUT /nnrf-nfm/v1/nf-instances/{nfInstanceID}`); free5GC AUSF `ue-authentications` context pool
**Boundary class:** NF-service-registry trust boundary — unvalidated service-endpoint fields let a registrant poison the discovery cache that other core NFs consult for control-plane routing; and a keyed in-memory state pool — a `sync.Map` keyed by SUPI only lets concurrent requests for the same subscriber overwrite live authentication state.

## Boundary 1 — NRF NF-registration poisoning via unvalidated NF Profile endpoints

free5GC NRF's `RegisterNFInstance` handler stores the full NF profile body **without validating any field** against 3GPP TS 29.510. The advisory's fuzzing found all 17 tested constraint violations accepted with HTTP 200/201:

- `nfInstanceId` accepts non-UUID strings (UUID v4 is required by §6.1.6.2.2).
- `nfStatus` accepts values outside the `{REGISTERED, SUSPENDED, UNDISCOVERABLE}` enum.
- `heartBeatTimer` accepts out-of-range values (0, 99999).
- `nfProfile` accepted as `null` (a mandatory field).
- **`nfServices.ipEndPoints` entries are stored with no IP-address validation** — arbitrary attacker-controlled addresses (`10.0.0.99`) register as legitimate NF service endpoints.

Profiles land in MongoDB's `NfProfile` collection, which has **no JSON schema validator**, and are advertised via `NFDiscover`. Legitimate NFs (SMF, UDF, etc.) query NRF for peer instances and route control-plane SBI traffic to whatever `ipEndPoints` the registry returned.

Attack chain (when OAuth/SBI auth is enforced on the *consumers*, but NRF's registration path itself is reachable):

1. A compromised or attacker-controlled NF registers a fake AMF (or any NF type) with `nfServices.ipEndPoints` pointing to the attacker's `10.0.0.99:7777`.
2. NRF stores the profile and advertises it through `NFDiscover`.
3. A SMF querying NRF for AMF instances receives the poisoned profile and initiates NAS/NGAP or SBI signaling toward the attacker endpoint.
4. Consequences: control-plane signaling interception, OAuth2 credential harvest (if tokens are presented to the fake NF), and subscriber DoS (the real AMF is shadowed).

The durable pattern: **a registry/lookup service that other components trust for peer discovery, where the registration input is unvalidated, is a poisoning target even when the consumers are properly authenticated.** The security failure is not the SBI transport — it's the *data-plane integrity* of the registry.

## Boundary 2 — AUSF SUPI-keyed auth-context overwrite via concurrent ue-authentications (GHSA-334q-h5g3-fpxv / CVE-2026-55784)

free5GC AUSF stores per-subscriber authentication state in a global `sync.Map` (`UePool` in `internal/context/context.go`) **keyed only by SUPI**. Every incoming `POST /nausf-auth/v1/ue-authentications` calls `NewAusfUeContext(supi)` and `AddAusfUeContextToPool`, which does an **unconditional `Store(supi, ctx)`** — replacing any in-flight authentication context for that SUPI. There is no `LoadOrStore` guard, no in-progress rejection, no per-SUPI rate limit, and the EAP session URL is derived from the SUPI/SUCI path itself, so all concurrent attempts for one subscriber share the same logical session.

An attacker who can reach the AUSF SBI/N12 interface sends concurrent ue-authentication requests for the same target SUPI. Each accepted request overwrites the previous context; a valid EAP-AKA' response for an earlier challenge is then verified against the latest context, whose `K_aut`/`XRES`/`EapID` no longer match the original challenge. Result: **targeted authentication DoS for that SUPI while the flood is maintained**. Confirmed on `ausf` v1.4.4 and main (as of June 2026).

The durable pattern: **a keyed in-memory state pool where the key is an attacker-controllable identifier (SUPI, session ID, tenant ID) and the write is unconditional `Store` is a state-clobber target.** The `sync.Map` makes the *map operations* thread-safe, but says nothing about *which procedure owns the state*. Any service that stores per-entity state keyed by an entity-supplied or entity-identifiable key — without a per-session nonce or an in-progress guard — is vulnerable to the same overwrite: one concurrent write per key destroys all in-flight state for that key.

## Replayable validation (lab only)

Preconditions: a lab free5GC deployment (NRF + at least one consuming NF, e.g. SMF), SBI/OAuth enabled as in production, an authorized lab endpoint to act as the fake NF, and a network recorder on the fake-NF listener. Do not poison a production NRF, do not target real subscribers, and do not harvest real OAuth tokens — capture only that a request *arrived* at your listener with the expected SBI shape.

1. **Enumerate the accepted fields.** Register a test NF instance with a valid UUID, then repeat the registration with each violation class (non-UUID ID, out-of-enum status, `heartBeatTimer=0`, `null` profile) and record HTTP status + stored document. The positive is 200/201 plus the malformed value persisted.
2. **Register the fake service endpoint.** Register a second (fake) NF instance of the same type as a real consumer target (e.g. an AMF if the lab SMF discovers AMFs) with `nfServices.ipEndPoints` pointing at your lab listener's IP:port. Keep every other field valid so the profile is indistinguishable from a legitimate one.
3. **Trigger discovery.** Cause the lab SMF (or equivalent consumer) to perform NF discovery for that type — e.g. via a lab UE attach or a direct `GET /nnrf-nrf/v1/nf-instances?...` as a permitted consumer. Confirm the poisoned instance appears in the response.
4. **Observe routing.** Monitor your listener for an SBI/NGAP/NAS connection attempt from the consumer. The positive is that the consumer contacted the attacker endpoint because the registry returned it. Record the request line, source, and SBI path — redact all tokens and subscriber identifiers.
5. **Negative control.** Re-run with a valid, in-lab endpoint as the fake NF and confirm the consumer reaches the lab endpoint instead; this proves the differential is the registry data, not the consumer's own validation.
6. **AUSF state-clobber (Boundary 2).** In the same lab, as a permitted AUSF consumer, start a real `POST /nausf-auth/v1/ue-authentications` for a synthetic lab SUPI, then immediately send a second (or small flood of) requests for the *same* SUPI and observe: every one is accepted (no in-progress rejection) and the lab subscriber's subsequent EAP-AKA' response fails verification against the overwritten context. The positive evidence is that N concurrent requests all returned 200/201 for one SUPI and the in-flight procedure's state no longer matches its challenge. Use synthetic lab subscribers only.

Stop at "consumer connected to the attacker-registered endpoint" (Boundary 1) and "concurrent same-SUPI ue-authentications all accepted and the in-flight procedure corrupted" (Boundary 2). Do not relay, modify, or respond to signaling as a real NF; do not extract real OAuth tokens or SUPIs; do not hold the poisoned profile longer than the lab window; do not target real subscribers with the flood.

## Recon heuristics

- **Map the discovery trust graph.** In any core/network system, list which services resolve peers from a shared registry (NRF, HSS/UDM, DNS-SD, service mesh, K8s service discovery, mDNS). For each registry, check whether registration input is schema-validated and whether an attacker-reachable write path exists.
- **Endpoint fields are the high-value target.** UUID/enum/range validation gaps are interesting, but the `ipEndPoints`/URL/callback field is what converts a registry entry into traffic redirection. Test endpoint fields with a lab listener even when the rest of the profile looks sane.
- **Schema-less stores amplify it.** If the registry persists to a document store without schema validation (Mongo `NfProfile` here), even fields the API "should" validate may be accepted. Capture the stored document as evidence, not just the API response.
- **Consumer-side hardening is a separate finding.** If consumers also fail to re-validate registry data (e.g. accept any IP, skip mutual auth on the redirected target), that's a second, independent finding — report it separately.
- **Hunt keyed state pools.** In any stateful service, grep for `sync.Map`/`map[Key]*State` where the key is an entity identifier (SUPI, tenant, session) and the write path is `Store`/direct assignment rather than `LoadOrStore`. Two concurrent requests for the same key is the test: does the second one reject, queue, or silently clobber? The EAP-AKA' case shows clobbering turns a race into a targeted DoS without any crash.

## Safe boundaries

- Authorized lab free5GC deployment only; SBI/OAuth enabled to mirror production so the result is meaningful.
- Attacker endpoint is a lab listener; evidence is "request arrived," never a captured token or subscriber identifier.
- PoC profiles are removed from the NRF after the test; no real UE traffic is redirected.
- Report the exact `nfServices.ipEndPoints` value, the discovery response showing the poisoned entry, and the consumer's connection to the lab endpoint.
