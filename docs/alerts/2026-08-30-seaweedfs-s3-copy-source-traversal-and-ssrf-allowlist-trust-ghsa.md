# SeaweedFS S3 copy-source traversal, Bifrost SSRF deny-list gaps, and phpSysInfo header trust — operator validation

**Date reviewed:** 2026-08-30
**Primary advisories:** [GHSA-56wq-x3wv-3ff4 / CVE-2026-55874](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-56wq-x3wv-3ff4) (high, 7.7) and [GHSA-hgpf-8634-g44c / CVE-2026-55873](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hgpf-8634-g44c) (medium, 4.3), SeaweedFS S3 gateway; [GHSA-w98g-5w9p-p3rc / CVE-2026-55245](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-w98g-5w9p-p3rc) (high), Bifrost gateway; [GHSA-786w-p5pm-cvgh / CVE-2026-55584](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-786w-p5pm-cvgh) (high, 7.5), phpSysInfo.
**Boundary class:** object-storage bucket isolation and SSRF/allow-list trust boundaries where the *second* input channel (header, request body URL, forwarded header) escapes the validation applied to the *first* one.

## 1. SeaweedFS S3 gateway: `X-Amz-Copy-Source` traversal breaks bucket isolation

The request URL path was hardened against traversal in 4.30 (CVE-2026-54917), but the `X-Amz-Copy-Source` header used by `CopyObject` and `UploadPartCopy` was only checked for emptiness. A `..` segment in the copy source survives into the server-side filer path and resolves into a *different* bucket.

The trust failure is a confused-deputy authorization mismatch:

- IAM evaluates the caller's policy against the bucket named in the **request URL** (the destination, which the caller owns).
- The copy **reads its source** from the `X-Amz-Copy-Source` value, which is not re-canonicalized against the same `IsValidBucketName` / `IsValidObjectKey` guards.

So an identity scoped to a single bucket (`Read` + `Write` on one bucket it controls) can read any object in any bucket on the instance and land the result in its own bucket:

```http
# caller authorized only for bucket-a
CopyObject destination: s3://bucket-a/stolen.txt
X-Amz-Copy-Source: /bucket-a/../victim-bucket/secret-object
```

`UploadPartCopy` (`CopyObjectPartHandler`) is affected by the same vector. All releases prior to **4.34** are affected; 4.34 validates the copy-source bucket and key with the same guards as the request URL.

Recon heuristic: whenever a product ships a traversal fix, enumerate *every* field that reaches the same path-resolution sink, not just the one that was patched — header-based source/destination selectors (`X-Amz-Copy-Source`, `SourceFile`, `From:`, redirect targets, backup/restore source paths) routinely keep the old validation.

## 2. SeaweedFS S3Tables / Iceberg REST: low-privilege S3 creds cross into management API

Requests signed with SigV4 service `s3tables` route to the S3Tables management API. Authorization on that path collapsed account-less S3 identities into the shared `admin` account and failed open, so a user holding only ordinary S3 `Read` credentials — and no S3Tables-specific permission — could invoke S3Tables management operations such as `GET /buckets` and enumerate administrator-owned table-bucket inventory (names and ARNs). The same handler backs the Iceberg REST catalog, affected by the same flaw.

Affected: SeaweedFS `>= 4.08, < 4.34` (S3Tables management API introduced in 4.08). Fixed in **4.34**: administrator status is decided by the `ACTION_ADMIN` capability rather than a collapsed `admin` account id, S3Tables authorization no longer defaults to allow, and the tautological `ListTableBuckets` gate was removed (related hardening in #9962, #9963, #9971).

Recon heuristic: for any object store that adds a management/catalog API (S3Tables, Iceberg REST, GCS, Azure), test whether an **ordinary data-plane credential** can reach management-plane routes. The two failures to look for are (a) an account-id collapse that maps unknown/absent accounts to a shared admin, and (b) authorization that defaults to allow when the capability model has no entry for the service.

## 3. Bifrost: `isPublicIP` SSRF deny-list omits routable internal-embedding ranges

`isPublicIP` in `core/providers/utils/fetch.go` — the deny-list that gates `FetchAndEncodeURL` — classifies several routable ranges as public:

- Carrier-Grade NAT `100.64.0.0/10` (RFC 6598)
- IPv6 6to4 `2002::/16`
- NAT64 `64:ff9b::/96` and `64:ff9b:1::/48`
- deprecated IPv6 site-local `fec0::/10`

An attacker who controls a multimodal image/document URL in a Bedrock or Vertex request body can drive the gateway to fetch internal services it should not reach — including the cloud instance-metadata endpoint via the 6to4 / NAT64 embeddings of `169.254.169.254`. The rest of the fetch hardening is correct and is **not** part of the finding: dial-time `LookupIP` + pin to `ips[0]` closes the DNS-rebinding TOCTOU, `CheckRedirect` re-validates redirect targets, and the scheme gate / 25 MiB cap / 20 s timeout all work. This is purely a residual IP-classification gap. Fixed in Bifrost `1.5.17`.

This is a durable bug-hunting pattern for **AI-gateway SSRF**: any LLM proxy that fetches user-supplied image/document URLs must have its IP-classifier audited for exactly this gap — "public" ranges that actually embed loopback/link-local/metadata addresses through encoding tricks.

## 4. phpSysInfo: `PSI_ALLOWED` allow-list trusts `X-Forwarded-For` before `REMOTE_ADDR`

phpSysInfo's `PSI_ALLOWED` IP allow-list is trivially bypassed by any unauthenticated remote attacker. The access-control check in `read_config.php` derives the client IP from the attacker-controlled `X-Forwarded-For` and `Client-IP` headers **before** falling back to `REMOTE_ADDR`:

```http
X-Forwarded-For: 10.0.0.1   # any configured allowed IP
```

...and the request is treated as coming from the allowed address, defeating the only IP-based access restriction the application provides. Affects all versions up to and including 3.4.x; fixed in 3.4.6.

Recon heuristic: for any product whose only access control is an IP allow-list, send `X-Forwarded-For` / `X-Real-IP` / `Client-IP` / `X-Forwarded-For` combinations with an allowed address. If the allow-list check reads the header before the socket peer address, it is bypassable end-to-end.

## 5. SeaweedFS follow-up: Filer JWT prefix match and unauth filer IAM gRPC (September 4 wave)

Two later SeaweedFS advisories extend the July/August S3-gateway work to the **Filer** (object-directory) identity layer. They belong on this page because they are the same product and the same class: a credential/policy representation that is checked one way at auth time but interpreted another way at the filer, plus a filer service that exposes S3-credential authority without authentication.

- **[GHSA-gv5w-hfx8-8cwq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gv5w-hfx8-8cwq) / CVE-2026-72921 — Filer JWT `allowed_prefixes` literal prefix match.** The Filer authorizer matches a credential's `allowed_prefixes` against the requested path using a **literal string-prefix** comparison instead of a bucket/prefix-boundary match. A caller whose JWT authorizes prefix `/bucket-a/` can therefore construct a requested path that string-prefixes the authorized prefix but resolves into a different bucket or outside it (e.g. `/bucket-a-secret/...`). The operator check: for any JWT/prefix-scoped storage authorizer, test the boundary between the *authorized prefix string* and the *actual path namespace* — especially when prefixes are not delimiter-terminated.
- **[GHSA-2v6v-25fm-p4fg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-2v6v-25fm-p4fg) / CVE-2026-72920 — unauthenticated filer IAM gRPC service grants S3 credentials.** A filer IAM gRPC endpoint issues S3 credentials without requiring authentication, so a network peer can mint credentials for a bucket/prefix it should not hold. The operator check: for any service that *issues* storage credentials, confirm the minting endpoint itself is authenticated and scoped, not just the endpoints that *consume* credentials.

Both are the same durable axis as the copy-source traversal above: **a storage-identity check whose representation (prefix string, gRPC auth gate) is looser than the namespace it is meant to confine.**

## Replayable validation (lab only)

### SeaweedFS copy-source traversal

Preconditions: a lab SeaweedFS S3 gateway (< 4.34), two buckets, and an IAM identity scoped to only `bucket-a`.

1. Seed `bucket-b/secret.txt` with a canary string the caller has no S3 read permission for; confirm a direct `GetObject` on `bucket-b/secret.txt` fails with AccessDenied (negative control).
2. As the `bucket-a`-only identity, issue `CopyObject` with destination `bucket-a/stolen.txt` and `X-Amz-Copy-Source: /bucket-a/../bucket-b/secret.txt`.
3. Positive: `stolen.txt` appears in `bucket-a` and `GetObject` on it returns the canary. The boundary proof is *destination bucket = caller's own, source bucket = other tenant's*. Stop there — do not enumerate other buckets, read credentials, or copy real tenant data.
4. Negative control on 4.34: the same request is rejected with an invalid copy-source error before any filer access.

### SeaweedFS S3Tables management reach

1. Create two identities in a lab SeaweedFS: one with only S3 `Read` on one bucket, one admin.
2. As the low-priv identity, sign a SigV4 request with service `s3tables` for `GET /buckets` against the management endpoint.
3. Positive on < 4.34: 200 with the admin-owned table-bucket inventory. Negative control on 4.34: 403. Do not create/mutate table buckets; inventory enumeration is the bounded proof.

### SeaweedFS Filer JWT prefix-match boundary

1. In a lab Filer, mint two JWTs: one with `allowed_prefixes: ["/bucket-a/"]` and a second scoped to a sibling bucket `/bucket-b/`. Seed one marker object in `bucket-b`.
2. As the `bucket-a/`-only identity, request a path that **string-prefixes** the authorized prefix but resolves outside it — e.g. a path beginning `/bucket-a-secret/` or `bucket-a/../bucket-b/marker` where the filer's matcher is a literal prefix. Record the filer's allow/deny decision and the resolved object.
3. A positive is the filer authorizing a request whose resolved namespace differs from the authorized prefix string. Capture the prefix string, the requested path, and the resolved path side by side. Do not read real tenant objects — one canary marker is the proof.
4. Negative control: the fixed filer build that matches on a delimiter-terminated bucket/prefix boundary.

### SeaweedFS unauth filer IAM gRPC credential minting

1. In a lab Filer, locate the IAM gRPC endpoint that issues S3 credentials.
2. From a plain network peer (no credentials), call the minting RPC for a bucket/prefix and record whether S3 credentials are returned. A positive is credential issuance without authentication.
3. Stop at the credential-issuance decision. Do not use the minted credentials to read or mutate real objects; confirm only that the minting gate is absent and note which buckets the returned identity would authorize.
4. Negative control: the fixed build, which requires authentication/scoping on the minting RPC.

### Bifrost IP-classifier check

1. Run Bifrost < 1.5.17 in a lab with a Bedrock/Vertex provider key pointing at a local mock.
2. Request a fetch through a multimodal URL whose final IP resolves into one of the omitted ranges (use a lab IP in `100.64.0.0/10` or a 6to4-embedded `169.254.169.254`; in cloud scope, the metadata endpoint itself is the canary — request it only if explicitly authorized).
3. Positive: the fetcher dials the internal address and returns the canary content. Record the classifier's decision per range in a table (range → expected → observed). Negative control on 1.5.17: all omitted ranges are rejected.
4. Do not exfiltrate real metadata credentials or internal service responses beyond the canary.

### phpSysInfo header trust

1. Deploy phpSysInfo ≤ 3.4.5 in a lab with `PSI_ALLOWED` set to a private IP you control.
2. Send `GET /` with no forwarding headers → confirm denial (negative control).
3. Send `GET /` with `X-Forwarded-For: <allowed-IP>` → positive if the system-information page is returned.
4. Record which header won (`X-Forwarded-For` vs `Client-IP` vs `REMOTE_ADDR` fallback order). Negative control on 3.4.6. Do not collect more system data than the access decision itself requires.

## Safe boundaries

- Authorized targets or isolated lab deployments only; exact product versions pinned so the negative control is meaningful.
- Two-tenant/bucket setups with the low-privilege identity scoped to exactly one bucket; no enumeration of unrelated tenants, no credential or key reads, no table-bucket mutation.
- SSRF proofs stop at the canary fetch and the classifier decision table; no internal service enumeration, no real metadata credential use.
- IP-allow-list proofs stop at the access decision; no further information gathering from the exposed system-information page.
- All evidence synthetic and redacted; report the exact input channel (header name, SigV4 service tag, allow-list variable) that escaped validation.
