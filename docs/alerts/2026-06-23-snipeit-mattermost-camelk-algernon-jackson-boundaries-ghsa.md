## August 28 follow-up: Snipe-IT cross-company, destructive-sink, and CSV/formula boundaries

A same-day Snipe-IT wave reinforces the same reusable bug-hunting heuristics. Durable patterns, not per-endpoint details:

- **FMCS cross-company re-parenting/deletion.** `PATCH /api/v1/maintenances/{id}` accepts a new `asset_id` and authorizes only the *existing* record's asset, not the new one, so a Company A user moves a maintenance record onto a Company B asset ([GHSA-575r-357h-fhch / CVE-2026-55516](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-575r-357h-fhch), high). The same class shows up in a `reports.view`-scoped delete endpoint that looks up `CheckoutAcceptance::pending()->find($id)` by global ID without re-checking the related asset's company scope ([GHSA-35cr-9hqq-p2mg / CVE-2026-55515](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-35cr-9hqq-p2mg)). Heuristic: on every multi-company update/delete, the authorization must bind to the **target** object's company, not the source's — enumerate `company_id`-accepting fields and delete-by-global-ID endpoints.
- **Destructive sinks authorized with a weaker permission than the UI route.** `POST /users/bulksave` soft-deletes a user when the caller has only `users.edit` while the confirmation route requires `users.delete` ([GHSA-vgx7-c78r-69w9 / CVE-2026-55460](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vgx7-c78r-69w9), high); `POST /account/request/.../cancel_by_admin?/` cancels any user's pending request when the truthy path segment is present with no authorization check ([GHSA-53jc-27pc-x8r8 / CVE-2026-55476](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-53jc-27pc-x8r8)). Heuristic: for each destructive action, compare the permission the *UI/route* gate checks against the permission the *sink* actually checks — a gap is the finding. Prove with a disposable user and a marker pending request; do not lock or delete real accounts.
- **Request-supplied filename into a filesystem join.** `displaySig` concatenates the route-supplied signature filename into a private-upload path with no sanitization, enabling arbitrary file read under the web server ([GHSA-c6f4-wj38-m3g3 / CVE-2026-55474](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c6f4-wj38-m3g3), high); a parallel path traversal reaches the CSV-import `image` field ([GHSA-xr9m-gphc-9p63 / CVE-2026-55469](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-xr9m-gphc-9p63)). Heuristic: any Snipe-IT action that echoes a filename into `storage_path`/`downloadFile`/`readfile` is a traversal probe. Prove only with a synthetic out-of-root canary file; do not read credentials or user data.
- **Stored value → CSV/spreadsheet formula.** `Actionlog::logaction()` stores the request `User-Agent`; the Activity Report CSV export writes it via `fputcsv()` without quoting, so a low-privileged user who logs an action with a formula-like UA plants a payload that executes when an admin opens the export in a spreadsheet ([GHSA-whrx-mmgr-gpcf / CVE-2026-55452](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-whrx-mmgr-gpcf)). Heuristic: audit every user-controlled field that lands in an exported CSV/XLSX and test for formula injection with an inert `=HYPERLINK("https://canary.example/")` canary — no exfiltration, no real endpoint.
- **Object-level authorization gaps on binding/creation routes.** `POST /api/v1/kits/{kit}/licenses` checks kit-edit but not the referenced license's ownership ([GHSA-crv3-j83j-f3r6 / CVE-2026-55478](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-crv3-j83j-f3r6)); location creation bypasses the FMCS parent/child company validation ([GHSA-8w8c-8mx9-52cw / CVE-2026-55472](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-8w8c-8mx9-52cw)). Heuristic: for each "bind/attach/create-with-reference" endpoint, supply a foreign object ID and confirm whether the reference is re-authorized.

Lower-priority items in the same wave (stored XSS via inline attachment / Markdown custom field, open redirect after user edit, CSS injection via `header_color`, `import.created_by` overwrite, legacy license-checkin permission, print-inventory authorization bypass) were reviewed and are standard XSS/redirect/mass-assignment notes that do not add a new boundary class; track them, revisit if they chain with the cross-company or destructive-sink findings above.

## August 31 follow-up: Snipe-IT sparse-permission mass-assignment wipe

**Advisory:** [GHSA-j5g3-42wp-gqm3 / CVE-2026-55843](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-j5g3-42wp-gqm3) — high (CVSS 6.5).

`UsersController::update()` passes the request `permission` field **unconditionally** to `NormalizePermissionsPayloadAction`, which returns an **empty array** when the field is absent. That empty result flows to `PreserveUnauthorizedPrivilegedPermissionsAction`, which restores *only* the `superuser` key (when the editor is not a superuser) and the `admin` key (when the editor is neither admin nor superuser). Every other permission — including `admin` when the editing user *is* an admin — is discarded, and `$user->permissions` is overwritten with the sparse result.

The durable pattern: **an absent request field is treated as "set this to empty," not "leave it unchanged."** Because the `canEditAuthFields` gate lets admins update any non-superuser account (including other admins), a `PUT /users/{id}` that omits `permission` silently and permanently destroys the target's admin flag and all granular permissions with no error. A secondary, lower-impact path exists for non-admin users holding `users.edit` who can wipe granular permissions off regular accounts the same way.

This is the destructive twin of the self-service permission mass-assignment items already in the table: there the field is *present* and out-of-envelope; here the field is *absent* and the missing-field normalization erases everything. Heuristic for any mass-assignment surface: **audit the missing-field path.** For each permission/role/tenant/capability field, verify that "not in the payload" means "preserve current value" and not "set to null/empty." Build the test as a before/after permission matrix on a disposable account, sending the minimal update payload that omits the protected field, and confirm whether the field survives.

Patched in `grokability/snipe-it` commit [`1cff2d67`](https://github.com/grokability/snipe-it/commit/1cff2d67aabd00ee51d864c1d7fb717494c1d6ad).

## Operator triage

1. **Start with privilege boundaries, not CVSS.** Prioritize routes where a low-privileged user supplies permission fields, tenant/team IDs, target namespaces, action URLs, hostnames, or type IDs.
2. **Build positive and negative role matrices.** For Snipe-IT and Mattermost, compare a no-permission user, a scoped editor, a team member, and an admin against the same endpoint.
3. **Keep Kubernetes checks synthetic.** For Camel K, use a disposable namespace, fake images, and inert pod templates; evidence is the generated resource placement decision, not workload execution.
4. **Constrain filesystem proofs.** For Algernon, create a disposable parent-directory canary and stop after proving one-level docroot escape or inert renderer invocation in a lab.
5. **Instrument Java harnesses.** For Jackson, use local classes that only set marker fields or perform canary DNS lookup; do not load gadget chains, JNDI endpoints, or production classpaths.

## Replayable validation boundaries

### Snipe-IT API mass assignment and selectlist enumeration

- Preconditions: owned Snipe-IT lab, disposable user accounts, known role assignments, and non-sensitive test users/assets.
- Baseline the user's current permissions and expected API denials.
- Attempt self-update, user-create, CSV-import, bulk-user-edit, bulk-asset-update, accessory-create, file-delete, and S3-signature retrieval requests that include fields or object IDs beyond the user's assigned role/company. Use harmless read/list permissions, synthetic companies, disposable assets, disposable user accounts, and marker files as the canary.
- Query selectlist endpoints with a logged-in low-privileged session and verify whether user IDs or identity metadata appear outside the role's expected scope.
- Positive evidence: before/after permission and tenant matrices, endpoint response codes, synthetic cross-company object placement, and redacted user-ID enumeration counts from lab accounts.

### Mattermost integration and team-ID authorization drift

- Preconditions: Mattermost lab in the affected version range, disposable teams/channels, a low-privileged authenticated user, and synthetic integration/playbook objects.
- For integration action URLs, compare path normalization between the configured integration URL and the API route ultimately invoked. Use harmless read/status or synthetic object routes only.
- For playbook runs, submit paired create-run requests where the permission-bearing team and target team differ.
- Positive evidence: route-decision table showing the privileged token or target-team mismatch with only disposable resources affected.

### Camel K build resource namespace steering

- Preconditions: disposable cluster or namespace, Camel K affected version, low-privileged namespace user, and no production operator namespace.
- Create only inert `Build` resources and inspect generated pod metadata, namespace placement, service account, and image references.
- Positive evidence: Kubernetes events or object YAML showing cross-namespace placement attempted or accepted.
- Stop before running arbitrary build steps, mounting secrets, or using real operator service accounts as proof.

### Algernon Host-to-filesystem join

- Preconditions: owned Algernon lab started with `--domain` or `--letsencrypt`, a document root, and one synthetic canary file in the parent directory.
- Send paired baseline and altered-Host requests and compare which filesystem root is selected.
- Positive evidence: retrieval or directory listing of only the synthetic parent canary, plus patched or hardened rejection if available.
- Do not read certificates, keys, logs, configs, user content, or sibling sites.

### Jackson type and DNS canaries

- Preconditions: local harness using the application's `ObjectMapper` configuration, disposable canary classes, and an owned DNS interaction domain.
- Test generic type IDs where the allowed raw container wraps a denied inert canary class.
- Test array-wrapped type IDs where the array shape is allowed but the component class should not be.
- Test `InetSocketAddress` JSON binding with an owned canary DNS name and verify whether resolution occurs during `readValue`.
- Positive evidence: exception/no-exception matrix, marker-field population for inert classes, and DNS query timestamps. Avoid real gadget classes or external callbacks beyond owned DNS canaries.

## Reporting notes

- Lead with the precise trust boundary: **self permission fields**, **selectlist enumeration**, **integration URL to admin-token API**, **team ID mismatch**, **CRD namespace steering**, **Host header to filesystem path**, or **Jackson type/DNS binding**.
- Include version, role, endpoint or object kind, sanitized request shape, expected authorization decision, actual decision, and a patched negative control when possible.
- Keep all proof artifacts disposable: synthetic accounts, teams, namespaces, marker files, inert Java classes, and owned canary domains.
- Do not include real user lists, production admin API results, Kubernetes secrets, filesystem secrets, or executable gadget payloads in wiki/report evidence.
