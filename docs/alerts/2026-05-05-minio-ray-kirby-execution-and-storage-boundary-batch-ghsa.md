# MinIO, Ray, and Kirby execution/storage boundary batch

**Signal:** GitHub Security Advisories REST fallback surfaced four durable advisories updated after the previous scan: **Ray CVE-2026-41486 / GHSA-mw35-8rx3-xf9r**, **MinIO CVE-2026-40344 / GHSA-9c4q-hq6p-c237**, **MinIO CVE-2026-41145 / GHSA-hv4r-mvr4-25vw**, and **Kirby CVE-2026-34587 / GHSA-jcjw-58rv-c452**.

## Advisory details

### Ray Data Parquet Arrow extension deserialization RCE

- **Package:** PyPI `ray`
- **Affected:** `>= 2.49.0, < 2.55.0`
- **Fixed:** `2.55.0`
- **Severity:** High
- **Issue:** Ray Data globally registers custom PyArrow extension types such as `ray.data.arrow_tensor`, `ray.data.arrow_tensor_v2`, and `ray.data.arrow_variable_shaped_tensor`. When PyArrow reads Parquet metadata containing those extension names, Ray's extension deserializer passes attacker-controlled metadata bytes to `cloudpickle.loads()`, enabling code execution during schema parsing before row data is read.

### MinIO unsigned-trailer upload signature bypasses

- **Package:** Go `github.com/minio/minio`
- **Affected:** releases from `RELEASE.2023-05-18T00-05-36Z` through the final open-source `minio/minio` release noted in the advisory
- **Fixed:** MinIO AIStor `RELEASE.2026-04-11T03-20-12Z`
- **Severity:** High
- **Issues:**
  - `PutObjectExtractHandler` / Snowball auto-extract failed to verify signatures for `STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`, accepting a valid access key plus fabricated signature.
  - `PutObjectHandler` and `PutObjectPartHandler` could skip signature verification when credentials were supplied only through query-string `X-Amz-Credential`; the verification gate depended on the `Authorization` header while authorization used either source.
  - In both paths, an attacker who knows a valid access key with write permission can write arbitrary objects without knowing the secret key.

### Kirby dynamic option double-resolution SSTI

- **Package:** Composer `getkirby/cms`
- **Affected:** `< 4.9.0`; `>= 5.0.0, < 5.4.0`
- **Fixed:** `4.9.0`, `5.4.0`
- **Severity:** High
- **Issue:** Kirby option fields (`checkboxes`, `color`, `multiselect`, `select`, `radio`, `tags`, and `toggles`) that source options from a query or API could treat dynamic option values/text as templates a second time. If option data is influenced by an authenticated Panel user or by an untrusted API/data source, template expressions can be evaluated server-side, exposing protected data or altering content/behavior.

## Why this is durable

These advisories are different technologies, but the trust-boundary shape is the same:

- Ray let file metadata become deserialization bytecode.
- MinIO let credential metadata become identity without requiring matching cryptographic proof in every upload handler.
- Kirby let dynamic option data become a server-side template after an earlier trusted query phase.

The reusable bug class is **second-phase interpretation of untrusted metadata**. A value first appears to be schema, credential placement, or display text; later, another subsystem interprets it as executable code, authentication state, or server-side template syntax.

## Immediate triage

1. **Patch first:** Ray to `2.55.0+`; Kirby to `4.9.0+` or `5.4.0+`; MinIO deployments per the vendor's fixed AIStor release or migration guidance.
2. **Inventory ingestion paths:** Ray/PyArrow/Pandas Parquet reads from user, partner, data-lake, object-store, or pipeline-provided files; MinIO S3-compatible upload surfaces; Kirby Panel sites using dynamic option fields or `OptionsApi` / `OptionsQuery`.
3. **Assume object stores are data-integrity sensitive:** for exposed MinIO deployments, review object write logs around unsigned-trailer uploads, Snowball auto-extract requests, multipart uploads, query-string credentials, and unexpected object creation/overwrites.
4. **Treat Ray Data readers as code-execution surfaces:** quarantine untrusted Parquet files, run data ingestion in isolated workers, and avoid shared credentials in parser processes.
5. **Review Kirby dynamic options:** confirm all option values from queries/APIs are trusted, escaped as data, or no longer double-resolved after patching.

## Hunt ideas

- Search Python dependency locks and container images for `ray>=2.49,<2.55`; grep code for `ray.data.read_parquet`, `pyarrow.parquet.read_table`, and `pandas.read_parquet` in processes where Ray is imported.
- Inspect data-lake/object-store access logs for newly introduced Parquet files from untrusted principals immediately before worker crashes, unusual outbound connections, or unexpected child processes.
- In MinIO logs, look for `STREAMING-UNSIGNED-PAYLOAD-TRAILER`, `X-Amz-Meta-Snowball-Auto-Extract: true`, `PutObjectPart`, query-string `X-Amz-Credential`, missing/odd `Authorization`, and writes using default or low-privilege access keys.
- Rotate MinIO keys that were broadly distributed, default, embedded in clients, or observed in suspicious upload paths; verify bucket policies after patching.
- Grep Kirby blueprints/plugins for dynamic options on `checkboxes`, `color`, `multiselect`, `select`, `radio`, `tags`, and `toggles`; test with literal `{{ ... }}` strings from untrusted sources and confirm they render as text, not executed queries.

## Durable controls

- Do not deserialize executable formats (`pickle`, `cloudpickle`, language object graphs) from file metadata, even when the file format is otherwise considered structured data.
- Keep signature verification and authorization coupled in a single fail-closed path. Every handler variant must prove the credential source, signature, and allowed action match.
- Avoid parser behavior that depends on header presence instead of the authenticated credential source actually used by policy decisions.
- Treat template syntax crossing a data boundary as tainted until explicitly escaped or wrapped in a typed literal.
- Add handler-parity tests: every upload/import/multipart/extract code path should share authentication invariants and regression tests.
- Run data and document ingestion workers with least privilege, no persistent secrets, network egress controls, and immutable input staging.

## Operator lesson

The dangerous moment is often not the first parse. It is the second interpreter that sees the same bytes later and decides they are code, credentials, or a template. Security reviews need to follow metadata through every phase until it becomes inert or intentionally authoritative.

## July 24 follow-up: Ray WebDataset default-decoder deserialization

[GHSA-hhrp-gw25-jr43 / CVE-2026-57516](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-hhrp-gw25-jr43) extends the Ray Data ingestion boundary to WebDataset TAR members. In affected Ray versions through 2.55.1, `ray.data.read_webdataset()` defaults `decoder=True`; the default decoder routes member extensions to handlers that use `pickle.loads()` for `.pickle`/`.pkl` and `torch.load(..., weights_only=False)` for `.pt`/`.pth`. The unsafe load occurs while the dataset is materialized through operations such as `take_all()` or `iter_batches()`, without a caller explicitly opting into pickle semantics. Ray 2.56.0 removes those formats from the default decoder.

### Reachability checklist

Confirm all of these before reporting exposure:

- the target calls `ray.data.read_webdataset()` rather than merely depending on Ray;
- an attacker, tenant, partner, model registry, object store, or workflow user can influence a TAR shard or its selected path;
- the caller leaves the default decoder enabled or supplies another decoder that reaches the same unsafe loads;
- the dataset is consumed far enough to decode members; and
- the worker's identity, filesystem, network, and secrets establish the realistic impact boundary.

### Inert two-extension harness

1. Use a disposable virtual environment, Ray worker, and temp directory. Do not run a tainted shard on a workstation, shared cluster, notebook service, or production worker.
2. Create a minimal WebDataset TAR with one ordinary text member and one test-only `.pkl` member. The serialized object should invoke a local Python function that increments a counter or writes one marker under the same temp root—no shell, subprocess, network, environment access, or external path.
3. Call the exact target API and materialization operation. Record whether the marker appears before application code intentionally reads the decoded object.
4. In a separate fixture, use a `.pt` member with an equivalent inert marker object only if PyTorch is part of the scoped target. Keep `.pkl` and `.pt` evidence separate because they reach different loaders.
5. Run negative controls with `decoder=None`, with a custom safe decoder that treats those extensions as opaque bytes, and with Ray 2.56.0 or later.
6. Record TAR member names, selected decoder, Ray/PyTorch versions, worker identity, the API call that triggers decoding, and marker timing.

A strong finding proves **attacker-influenced WebDataset shard -> extension-dispatched default decoder -> unsafe Python object load -> inert side effect in the Ray worker**. Do not publish a weaponized pickle, read credentials, or use outbound callbacks. Distinguish this WebDataset code path from the earlier Parquet Arrow-extension advisory: fixing or negatively testing one does not prove the other is safe.
