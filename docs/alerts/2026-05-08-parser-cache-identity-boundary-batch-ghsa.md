# Parser, cache, identity, and transport-auth boundary batch

**Signal:** GitHub Security Advisories REST fallback surfaced a **2026-05-08 17:15 UTC** batch where small parser, cache, identity-provider, and transport-auth mistakes crossed security boundaries: encoded path segments bypassing directory policy, unbounded negotiation caches, LDAP filter injection, missing DTLS fingerprint validation, and registry token audience drift.

## Advisories covered

- **fast-uri percent-encoded dot-segment traversal** — [GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-q3j6-qgpj-74h6): `fast-uri <= 3.1.0` accepted percent-encoded `.` / `..` segments in paths; patch to `3.1.1+`.
- **@fastify/accepts-serializer Accept-header cache DoS** — [GHSA-qxhc-wx3p-2wmg](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qxhc-wx3p-2wmg): `@fastify/accepts-serializer <= 6.0.3` could grow negotiation caches without bound; patch to `6.0.4+`.
- **ZITADEL LDAP filter injection in login flow** — [GHSA-rxvx-hhpj-q6px](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-rxvx-hhpj-q6px): affected `github.com/zitadel/zitadel` 2.71.x, 3.x, and 4.x ranges; patch to the fixed tracks (`3.4.10+` or `4.15.0+` where applicable).
- **ex_webrtc client-role handshake missing DTLS peer-fingerprint validation** — [GHSA-qwfw-ggxw-577c](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-qwfw-ggxw-577c): patch `ex_webrtc` to `0.15.1+` or `0.16.1+`.
- **MCP Registry OIDC audience replay across deployments** — [GHSA-95c3-6vvw-4mrq](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-95c3-6vvw-4mrq): `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry < 1.7.6` used a shared GitHub OIDC audience; patch to `1.7.6+`.
- **MCP Registry protocol-relative open redirect** — [GHSA-v8vw-gw5j-w7m6](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-v8vw-gw5j-w7m6): `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry >= 1.1.0, < 1.7.5`; patch to `1.7.5+`.

## Why this is durable

These are all **canonicalization and authority-binding bugs**. A path is checked before all encodings collapse; a cache key is attacker-chosen and unbudgeted; an LDAP query treats identity text as syntax; a media transport trusts the handshake role instead of the peer fingerprint; an OIDC token validates issuer but not deployment-specific audience; a redirect normalizes slashes after deciding the destination is local.

## Immediate triage

1. Search SBOMs for `fast-uri <= 3.1.0`, `@fastify/accepts-serializer <= 6.0.3`, affected `zitadel`, `ex_webrtc`, and `github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry` versions.
2. For URL/path policy code, add tests with `%2e`, `%2e%2e`, mixed case encodings, encoded slash/backslash, double-encoding, and path normalization before allow/deny decisions.
3. For Fastify deployments, review request volume and memory graphs for high-cardinality `Accept` headers, especially unauthenticated routes.
4. For ZITADEL, hunt login attempts with LDAP metacharacters (`*`, `(`, `)`, `\`, NUL escapes) and unexpected directory search breadth.
5. For WebRTC and OIDC, verify logs include validated DTLS fingerprints and deployment-specific token audiences before accepting trust decisions.

## Durable controls

- Decode and normalize once at trust-boundary ingress, then run policy on canonical values; reject ambiguous or lossy encodings instead of repairing them later.
- Put explicit size, cardinality, and TTL limits on attacker-influenced caches; include cache eviction metrics and per-route budgets.
- Build LDAP, SQL, and filter syntax with typed escaping APIs, not string interpolation; log the escaped query class, not raw secrets.
- Bind real-time media sessions to expected peer fingerprints and fail closed when SDP/DTLS material changes mid-flow.
- Scope OIDC audiences per deployment/environment and reject issuer-only validation. Treat redirects as relative-path-only unless the origin is pre-registered.

## July 29 ZITADEL self-verification follow-up

[GHSA-jq8w-8q2f-ffm9 / CVE-2026-54693](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jq8w-8q2f-ffm9) extends ZITADEL identity testing beyond LDAP query construction. After an earlier update route stopped accepting a caller-supplied `is_verified` flag, additional self-management API paths could return the email or phone verification code to the same user. That lets proof issuance collapse into proof consumption for an address or number the user does not control.

Use one disposable user, owned email aliases, and test phone numbers only. For each enabled API generation and version, record the subject, old/new contact value, endpoint, caller permissions, whether a challenge was sent to the contact channel, whether the code appeared in the API response, and whether the verified flag changed. Keep direct `is_verified` mutation and returned-code paths as separate rows. Repeat on 4.15.1 or 3.4.11 as applicable. Strong evidence is **self-service contact change -> verification secret returned to the same session -> secret accepted -> synthetic contact marked verified without channel possession**. Never claim account takeover unless a separate relying policy grants it, and never test addresses or numbers you do not own.
